# Font Catalogue
Font Catalogue is an application that displays all fonts available on the iOS device running. 
This is an updated version of the application that I submitted as part of the recruitment process at a software company.
Originally written for iOS 6, it has been updated to run on iOS 8 and 9 devices.

## Functionality
Font Catalogue allows the user to:
- remove font names from the table
- reorder font names in the table
- change the alignment of the font names (i.e. the font names in the table will be either left or right aligned)
- reverse the characters in the font names
- sort the font names alphanumerically ascending
- sort the font names by chracter count ascending
- sort the font names by the display size of the font name
- reverse the order of the font names
- revert the list of font names to the original default state 
- view the letters (upper case and lower case) and numbers in a font, when tapping on the font name in the table

## Assumptions
The below are the assumptions for the application:
- It is an iOS 8 or 9 iPhone only application
- It does not work if the application is running in the background
